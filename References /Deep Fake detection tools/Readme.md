# Deepfake detection tools

## 1) FakeCatcher
FakeCatcher operates by identifying authentic clues in real videos, such as the subtle “blood flow” changes in the pixels of a video. When our hearts pump blood, our veins change colour, and these blood flow signals are collected from all over the face. Algorithms then translate these signals into spatiotemporal maps, and with the help of deep learning models, FakeCatcher can instantly determine whether a video is real or fake.
- Can detect fake videos with a 96% accuracy rate
- Returns result in milliseconds
- Uses subtle “blood flow” in the pixels of a video to detect deepfakes
- Runs on Intel hardware and software, interfacing through a web-based platform

## 2) Microsoft video Authenticator
It's a powerful weapon in the fight against disinformation, capable of detecting the blending boundary of deepfakes and subtle grayscale changes that are often undetectable to the human eye.
- Provides a real-time confidence score
- Detects subtle grayscale changes
- Allows for immediate detection of deepfakes
- Partnerships with AI Foundation, media companies, and more for responsible use and wide adoption

## 3) Sentinal
Sentinel, a Deepfake detection technology is designed for democratic governments, defence agencies, and enterprises; Sentinel offers an AI-based protection platform that combats the threat of deepfakes.
- Automated analysis of uploaded digital media
- Detailed visualization of detected manipulations
- Largest database of verified deepfakes
- Multi-layer defence for high accuracy
- AI-generated audio classification
- Ensemble of neural network classifiers

## 4) Deepware
Deepware Scanner is built on the EfficientNet-B7 model of the convolutional neural network architecture. This model, known for its uniform scaling of all CNN dimensions, ensures higher accuracy and cost-efficiency. The primary dataset used is the CFDF dataset, which contains 120,000 consented videos. Test datasets include 4chan Real, MrDeepFakes, Celeb-DF YouTube, and others, making Deepware Scanner a comprehensive tool for deepfake detection.
- Open-source Deepfake detection tool
- Based on the EfficientNet-B7 model
- Uses CFDF dataset with 120,000 consented videos
- Tested on multiple datasets like MrDeepFakes, Celeb-DF YouTube, and 4chan Real.
