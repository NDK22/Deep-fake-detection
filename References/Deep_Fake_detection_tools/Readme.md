# Deepfake detection tools

## 1) FakeCatcher
FakeCatcher operates by identifying authentic clues in real videos, such as the subtle “blood flow” changes in the pixels of a video. When our hearts pump blood, our veins change colour, and these blood flow signals are collected from all over the face. Algorithms then translate these signals into spatiotemporal maps, and with the help of deep learning models, FakeCatcher can instantly determine whether a video is real or fake.
- Can detect fake videos with a 96% accuracy rate
- Returns result in milliseconds
- Uses subtle “blood flow” in the pixels of a video to detect deepfakes
- Runs on Intel hardware and software, interfacing through a web-based platform

## 2) Microsoft video Authenticator
It's a powerful weapon in the fight against disinformation, capable of detecting the blending boundary of deepfakes and subtle grayscale changes that are often undetectable to the human eye.
- Provides a real-time confidence score
- Detects subtle grayscale changes
- Allows for immediate detection of deepfakes
- Partnerships with AI Foundation, media companies, and more for responsible use and wide adoption

## 3) Sentinal
